# A_survey_on_value_based_deep_reinforcement_learning
Reinforcement learning(RL) address the problem of how to make a sequential decision in the real world. It aims to maximize the total reward in the task. In recent years, deep learning is one of the attractive fields, and it has pushed the limits of what was possible in the domain of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Combine with RL and deep learning is a trendy field in the regime of artificial intelligence(AI). It named as deep RL. It represents a step towards developing autonomous systems with a higher-level understanding of the observed world. There are various subfields for deep RL, but the arise of deep RL should back to the DQN algorithm, which is proposed by \cite{1} . In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field or deep RL, then focus on value-based deep RL, which is one of the bases in deep RL. Our survey will cover the central algorithm in the value-based deep RL field. We will review the latest research results and also recall the issue in value-based method, especially, the problems in using function approximation for RL. We hope to inspire novel research methods of the value-based algorithm.
